		<h2>Pichu (Japanese: ピチュー Pichuu) is an Electric-type Baby Pokémon introduced in Generation II.</h2>
		<h2>Biology<br/><hr/>Physiology<br/>Pichu are very small, plump, yellow rodent-like Pokémon. It bears a similar appearance to its evolved form <a href="index.html">Pikachu</a>, but varies in a number of ways. Pichu have diamond-shaped ears on the top of their head, with the edges being black and the interior yellow. Underneath their head is a black pattern, that somewhat resembles a collar. Their tails are completely black, and resemble a small lightning bolt, similar to its evolved forms, which are larger. Pichu also have round, pink sacs on their cheeks, used for storing electricity.</h2>
		<h2>Natural abilities<br/><hr/>Pichu have the special ability Static. This allows for a 30% chance that an opponent will become paralyzed if it lands a physical attack on Pichu. Pichu, like its other forms, is capable of storing electricity in the pink sacs on its cheeks. Being a baby Pokémon, however, Pichu can not store as much electricity as its evolved forms. It will shock itself if any electricity leaks out of its cheeks.</h2>
